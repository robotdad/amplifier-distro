description: >
  Daily intelligence brief. Reads recent session handoffs, project status,
  and memory to produce a concise "here's what happened, here's what's hot"
  summary.

steps:
  - id: gather-handoffs
    agent: start:session-handoff
    instruction: >
      Survey all recent session handoffs from the past 24 hours.
      Look in ~/.amplifier/projects/*/handoff.md for handoff files.
      Read each one and extract: what was accomplished, what's in progress,
      key decisions, and suggested next steps.
      Return a structured summary of all recent session activity.

  - id: check-health
    agent: start:health-checker
    instruction: >
      Run a quick environment health check. Focus on: are API keys set,
      is the bundle loading correctly, any cache issues? Keep it brief -
      just flag problems, don't elaborate on passing checks.

  - id: synthesize-brief
    instruction: >
      Based on the session handoff survey and health check results, produce
      a concise morning brief for the user. Format:

      ```
      Good morning. Since your last session:
        - [Key accomplishments from handoffs]
        - [In-progress items]

      Environment: [health status - brief]

      Suggested focus today:
        1. [Top priority from handoffs]
        2. [Second priority]
        3. [Third priority]

      What would you like to focus on?
      ```

      Keep it scannable. Under 15 seconds to read. Prioritize by
      impact and urgency based on handoff content.
